  <ul>
    <li>Bringing consistently fresh ingredients to every location</li>

    <li>Balancing premium ingredients with fair pricing</li>
    <li>Partnering with reliable, certified suppliers</li>
    <li>Introducing innovation without compromising quality</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Today, Habit Burger operates using a blended sourcing approach, combining national consistency with strategic regional flexibility to maintain freshness.</p>
